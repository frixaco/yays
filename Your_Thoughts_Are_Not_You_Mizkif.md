The one thing that has never changed is you have experienced all of it. You are that which experiences. You're not the experience itself. You are the thing that experiences everything in your life. Does that make sense? So you don't experience what I experience and I don't experience what you experience. We can have the same thought. We can have the same desire. We can have all kinds of similar things. We can have the same emotion. But you experience your life and I experience mine. That is the foundation of who you are. The problem is that what we are is like a, we're like a monitor. and the monitor displays stuff, but the monitor isn't what it displays. The water on the monitor is not wet, right? So this is what's weird, is that you're actually none of those thoughts, all of those worries that you have, oh my God, I'm 28, I'm balding. That's just thoughts. That's all it is. You get that? It's a thought and it's emotion. It's not you. Literally, what it is is a fear, an insecurity. It's an object of the mind. It is not a person. A person is that which experiences. Does that make sense at all? Yeah. Thank you.
